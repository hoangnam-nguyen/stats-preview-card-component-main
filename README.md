## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- Use rem units instead of px in most cases to facilitate responsive design
- Get used to mobile-first workflow
- Add an image to html as a background-image of a div, then create a pseudo-element to add an additional layer to the image

```css
.image {
    position: relative;
    height: 18.75rem;
    background-size: cover;
    background-image: url('images/image-header-mobile.jpg');
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: center;
}

.image::before {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    background: var(--clr-primary-violet);
    mix-blend-mode: soft-light;
}
```

- A simple way to center (horizontally and vertically) a div inside `body` using flexbox:

```css
body {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    min-height: 100vh;
}
```

- If there is an image inside a div, setting `overflow: hidden;` makes sure the image will not spill out of the div's area. This is useful for instance when setting `border-radius` for div.

```css
div {
    border-radius: 1rem;
    overflow: hidden;
}
```


### Useful resources

- [CSS Units Best Practice](https://gist.github.com/basham/2175a16ab7c60ce8e001)
- [A Complete Guide of responsive web design using CSS rem and em Units](https://dev.to/romankhan/a-complete-guide-of-responsive-web-design-using-css-rem-and-em-units-4j6k) - These sources helped me realize the need to use rem/em units more than absolute units (like px), as a good practice for professional responsive web design. I really liked this method and will use it going forward.
